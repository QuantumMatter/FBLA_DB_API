# FBLA_DB_API

## Intoduction

In this repository, you will find my, David Kopala's, API part of the submission to the 2015 FBLA Mobile Appllication
Development.

If you want the entire rundown of what my project is, head on over to https://github.com/QuantumMatter/FBLA_App and
check out the introduction.

##Testing

This repository consists of the source code for the HTTP API for my web-base SQL Server database, and there is no
gaurantees that it will run on your computer. For a full working version that has been implemented into my app,
please visit http://24.8.58.134/david to see it in action

PLEASE NOTE: You will need a PC with visual studio to be able to view the project.

### Step One: Cloning

To begin, start off by cloning this repository to PC.

### Step Two: Opening

Secondly, open the file location where you clone the repository at. Navigate to the SQL_API_04.sln file under
FBLA_DB_API\SQL_API_04. Double click on the file to open it in Visual Studio.

### Step Three: Evaluate

Since my project is referencing a SQL DB on the computer that's hosting the site, that chances you are able to access
it might be pretty slim. If you are unable to debug and run the API through Visual Studio, please visit my site at
http://24.8.58.134/david to see how it works, but still use these files to look through mt source code.
